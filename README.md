Easy way to compile markdown into documents.

This project is meant to make writing easier and more productive.

So you want to write a document.
Maybe you'll share it on the web.
Maybe you want a polished pdf. 
Maybe it's a blog, research paper, book draft, or just a set of notes.
You don't want to think about typesetting details.
You just want to throw your ideas in some plain text files and call `make`.

This is my first example of using quarto, following the quarto
[Get Started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/text-editor.html).
