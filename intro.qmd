What this is for
--------------------------------------------

This is a starter template for using [quarto](https://quarto.org/).
It seems to achieve a lot of what I was trying to do with
[markdown-memo](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-memo) and
[markdown-easy][https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy)---make
technical and scholarly writing easier and more productive.
