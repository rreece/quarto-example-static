What this is for
--------------------------------------------

This is a starter template for using [quarto](https://quarto.org/).
It seems to achieve a lot of what I was trying to do with
[markdown-memo](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-memo) and
[markdown-easy](https://github.com/rreece/markdown-easy):
*make technical and scholarly writing easier and more productive*.

So you want to write a document.
Maybe you'll share it on the web.
Maybe you want a polished pdf. 
Maybe it's a blog, research paper, book draft, or just a set of notes.
You don't want to think about typesetting details.
You just want to throw your ideas in some plain text files and call `make`.

See the README for [quarto-example-static](https://github.com/rreece/quarto-example-static)
for how to compile the document to html or pdf.
